String comparisons are case-sensitive.

## Special Handling for Comma-Separated Fields

When the filter name ends in "experiment_ids", the filter is interpreted as follows:

| "a,b" | EXCLUDES ["b"] | No match |

Note: The BETWEEN relation is not supported for comma-separated values.

Note: CSV field comparisons are case-insensitive.

## Handling of datetime and timestamp values

DATETIME or TIMESTAMP-type columns support INCLUDES/EXCLUDES/BETWEEN, similar to numerics.

Values must be expressed as ISO8601 datetime strings compatible with Python's datetime.fromisoformat()
(https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat).
