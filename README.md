# xngin dash

## Getting Started

1. Start your xngin apiserver backend.
2. Run the frontend development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You may also want to install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/).

Most of the UI was generated using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and Anthropic Claude.

## Generated API Clients

This project invokes xngin API methods via a client library generated by [Orval](https://github.com/orval-labs/orval).
The generated code is committed to [src/api/](src/api/). Orval is configured in [orval.config.ts](./orval.config.ts).

If the API changes, you can update the generated clients by running the following command to refresh the OpenAPI spec
from your local development server:

```bash
task update-api-spec
```
