## How is it built?

| UI Components | [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)                                                                                         |
| API Client    | [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), [Orval](https://github.com/orval-labs/orval), [custom fetcher](./src/services/orval-fetch.ts) |

Most of the UI was generated using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and Anthropic Claude.

## Generated API Clients

This project invokes xngin API methods via a client library generated by [Orval](https://github.com/orval-labs/orval).
The generated code is committed to [src/api/](src/api/). Orval is configured in [orval.config.ts](./orval.config.ts).

If the API changes, you can update the generated clients by running:

```bash
task update-api-spec
```

This will attempt to fetch the latest spec from your local dev server, or if that's not available,
main.dev.agencyfund.org.
